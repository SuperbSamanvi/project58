         My favorite hobbie is reading book. My  favorite book is Percy jackson. It is written by Rick Riordan. I got this habbit naturally. I am in 5th grade 10yrs. I love reading books in my free time rather that watching TV. Books give a lot of knowelegde. Books can also give you thoughts to write a book. I have already started writing a book. It is caled The Famous Explorers. Everyone should get a habbit of reading books. Books are the best sorce of entertainment.</p>
